# This file contains all of the editor's command and key linkages.
# It also contains data for tables which are automatically generated in the
# editor.
#
# It should be processed by the "mktbls" program, which produces the
#  headers #included by main.c
#
# All that is necessary to add a new function to the editor is to add
#  an entry to this file, write the function, make sure it's in the
#  makefile, and rebuild.  (This is not to be confused with adding a
#  new key binding, which can be done with the rebind command if it
#  was compiled in.)
#
# If you want to know which keyboard bindings are already taken, look
#  at nebind.h, after you build it.
#
# The entries are functions within the editor.  They _must_ match the
#  functions' names.  On the same line as the name is the set of flags
#  describing that function.
# Also accompanying each function is a list of english names  for the 
#  command, in double quotes, and a list of keys bound to the command,
#  in single quotes.  These are the default key bindings -- they can change
#  at runtime.  English names must be all lowercase.
# Any function, name, or key may be followed by a conditional, i.e. the
#  name of a preprocessor #define which must be defined non-zero for that
#  line to become part of the editor.  If a function name is made conditional,
#  the names and keys listed with it will be conditional also.
# The names and keys must be preceded by a tab character.
# Blank lines must be completely empty.
# For convenience only, this table is kept in roughly alphabetical order, 
#  by first character of function name.
#
# For example, consider the following entry:
#
# 	somefunc	ABSM|MOTION		BSD|DOS
#		"funkycom"
#		'^X-F'
#		'FN-2'				DOS
#		'M-s'
#
# As a special case, if a function key definition ('FN-A') is followed
# by a conditional beginning with "KEY_", like:
#		'FN-A'				KEY_Up
# then that name is output to nefkeys.h as a SPEC|x definition, for use
# by the screen/keyboard drivers.  The key is also bound, as usual, and
# is made conditional on the _third_ field on the line.  (Since KEY_xxx
# definitions are meant to be pretty generic, there should be little
# need for conditional build-time binding.)
#
# This says that somefunc() is an absolute motion command, that it should
#  only be included in the editor if we're running BSD or DOS, that its
#  english name as one would type on the command line is "funkycom", and
#  that it is bound to ^X-F, to function key 2 under DOS, and to "meta-s",
#  that is, an 's' with the high bit set.
#
# Function flags have the following meanings:
#	REDO means the dotcmd command recorder should be halted, so that
#		the command can be redone.
#	UNDO means the undo stacks should be cleared, in preparation for
#		an undoable command.
#	OPER means the command is an "operator", that is, it acts on a region
#		demarcated by the current cursor position and the cursor 
#		position following a subsequent motion command.
#	MOTION means this command moves dot, and specifically is compatible
#		with the operator commands.
#	FL only occurs with MOTION, means that if the motion is an argument
#		to an operator, the operation should affect Full Lines
#	ABSM only occurs with MOTION, means that the motion is absolute,
#		i.e. not relative to the current position or screen.  It causes
#		the "lastdotmark", ldmark to be set to dot before the move
#		takes place.
#	GOAL signifies a motion that will attempt to retain the 
#		current column position after the motion.
#	GLOBOK says the function can follow a global command
#		(e.g. the 'd' in "g/pattern/d")
#
#	This file was designed and constructed by Paul Fox for vile, (c)1990
#
#	The flags given in parentheses are "ex" flags, related to what
#		kind of line-range arguments the command can take.  Not all are
#		currently used or implemented, but they were defined in the
#		command table for the Steve Kirkendall's elvis editor, so I
#		included them here for completeness.
#	BANG says the command (in real vi) can take a trailing ! character,
#		and will behave differently.  In vile, most such commands
#		have separate entries, e.g. quit and quithard and separate
#		functions which are executed.  in some cases this is very
#		impractical, as is the case with w and w!  -- so, if a command
#		is entered ending with a '!' (it must be in this table by
#		that name) _and_ the BANG flag is set for that command, then
#		the function will be invoked with "special" values for f and
#		n (i.e. values unlikely to be typed) so the function can
#		distinguish the two cases.
#		If the BANG flag appears, and there is no command-name ending
#		in '!' listed, then the flag does nothing, and should be
#		viewed simply as documentation.
