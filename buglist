	(E means enhancement, L,M,H are low, medium, high priority)
----------------------

M	longnames cause severe portability constraint -- does the shortnames
	stuff take care of this?

L	formatregion code leaves an extra space after reformatting a paragraph

L	why does file reading seem so slow?

L	why is searching so slow?

L	the ^A-* command doesn't work as advertised -- won't replace
	list if already there.

L	there may be a bug in queryreplace due to output of thescanner() not
	being checked for ABORT, but it's ifdefed BEFORE anyway

E	The "0r" command, for reading a file in above line 1 doesn't work,
	because token parsing sees the zero as a number, not part of the
	command.  The "R" synonym does, however -- okay for now.

E	need a "file newer than buffer" warning.  Should stat the file, and
	store it's mod time, compare to current when going back to that window,
	after performing some shell command.  e.g., if you're editing a file
	that is created by a script you're testing, then you want to be warned
	that the file is out of date after doing a test run of the script.

E	should be able to refer to remote tags file, and have paths
	contained there be relative to _its_ location, rather than the current
	directory.

E	wrap mode doesn't autoindent, even with cmode set.  kinda useless.

E	add a command-line expansion character to be the list of files
	mentioned in "tags"

E	should there be a "significant-length" for tags?

E	add another mode, which will "!get -p" an SCCS or RCS file if 
	the clear-text file isn't found

E	add _another_ mode, similar to the above, which will do a caseless 
	match against filenames mentioned in tags

E	it would be nice if ^X!! reran the last command into [Output]

E	add support for sh comments to format() code

E	why can't I kill a displayed buffer?  simply bring up the previous.
	
E	can g become an operator?  It should, since we don't have addresses.

E	add C comments to CFENCE matching code

E	add support for C comments to format() code

E	adjust window size of popups based on length of buffer

E	collapse command execution code to as few places as possible.
	Its currently spread through main(), execute(), operator(),
	docmd(), and usekreg(). The usekreg() function should be 
	moved into getcmd(), since it is really processing prefixes,
	and isn't really a command.
	
E	mlreply line should ideally be a one line buffer, so editing
	can be done on it.  or possibly have a subset of line-
	oriented commands that would work on it.

E	BSD interrupt processing is botched during a read() of the keyboard.
	The read doesn't return -1 as it does under sysV (USG).
	So you can bang on ^C all day and nothing will happen.
	[I'm not sure this is true anymore  -pgf]
	
E	The ! operator shouldn't be too hard to add.  A combination of
	^W, killregion, fork, and ^R should do it.  Use a named
	pipe (i.e. popen("command >pipe &","w"); fork; read("pipe"))
	to make #ifdefing with the non-unix versions easier.

E	This editor does not virtualize buffers out to disk.  It is quite 
	a memory hog.  But isn't that what /dev/swap is for?  But
	seriously, I haven't even come close to testing it for
	memory-full conditions.  Some malloc() packages give 95%
	warnings -- perhaps something like that should be done for
	safety.

E	to make the code shrink, could probably try to eliminate
	sprintf and its brethren.  mlwrite already does format
	expansion, it could probably be turned into a doprnt-like
	beast, and that used as a basis for our own sprintf,fprintf
	How does one write [sfp]printf and doprnt using varargs?

E	marks should perhaps be linked onto lines.  this would make a lot
        of things a lot easier, since a mark would travel with the
        line, instead of having to be moved when the line is
        reallocated etc.  the U line could be treated as a special
        mark.  The "copied" flag needed by undo could be a special
        sort of mark as well.  Implementation of the "tag stack"
	would be aided by this as well.

E	there is currently no way to change working directories -- it's
	not clear whether that should be a global thing, or perhaps
	a per-buffer notion.

E	there is code (in imdying()) that attempts to save unwritten buffers
	on hangups.  It is fairly crude, having been written quickly
	in self-defense during debugging.  It should be examined and
	fixed.

E	:e and :n should be able to deal with multiple filenames resulting
	from filename globbing.  vi has this problem too.  At least
	vile lets you choose to choose the first such name.

E	^W should erase word in input mode
E	killc should erase line in input mode

E	All code should pass lint.  This won't be easy...
