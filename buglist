	(E means enhancement, L,M,H are low, medium, high priority)
----------------------

H	The mvrightwind and mvleftwind functions are broken -- visiting lines
	that are too short to be visible when the screen is shifted will
	cause junk on the screen.

E	should add a "show-vars" command

E	everybody and their sibling wants "map", "map!", and "abb".
	the first step to supporting this is making macro/dotcmd replay be
	properly fully nested, and generalized.  I think, for instance that
	if an @a macro invoked a @b macro, or a ^X-& macro, there'd be
	reentrancy problems.

E	add "set autowrite", ":n file" (what does that do?), "set nu", "set
	noredraw"

E	now that paragraphs, sections, and sentences are all selectable
	with regexps, they (and the tabstop value) are prime candidates for
	moving into a "mode-values" set of values.  A buffer would inherit
	either the global normal-mode values, or the global c-mode values.

E	should the "value'd" modes be variables?  vice-versa?  Probably the
	notion of variables should be unified with the values somehow, possibly
	via a new valueset containing just the variables.  they would not
	be inherited by buffers, but would always be global.  the CSUFFIXES
	value would be a good thing to move there, since it doesn't make sense
	as a per-buffer value.  Or else the variables should be checked for
	matches after the rest of the value sets.

E	:k, to set a mark, won't work as ":ka" or ":kb".  Must use ":k a"

E	patterns as addresses do not work, e.g. ":/str1/,/str2/d".  They're
	hard to parse the way things are set up right now.  We could accumulate
	the whole commandline, and then parse it, the way real vi does, but we'd
	lose the "prompt and display last response" behavior.

E	In vi, the join command is supposed to act either on a region (from
	the command line, as in ":13,15j"), or it should take a simple
	count, from vi mode, as in "3j".  Right now vile _only_ does the
	simple count form of the command.

E	should add an option to support file locking, rather than the current
	ifdef stuff.  (this is only useful if we match the GNU locking
	protocol.) And it's not clear that in an NFS'ed environment that
	it's all that easy to get that style of locking right anyway.

E	the scrsearch functions could become region based -- as in "search for
	the next occurrence of the region", which would usually be a word.  And
	the ^A/ version could become "a/ (search for teh contents of buffer a),
	if you know what I mean.

E	need a "file newer than buffer" warning.  Should stat the file, and
	store it's mod time, compare to current when going back to that window,
	after performing some shell command, or just before modifying it. 
	e.g., if you're editing a file that is created by a script you're
	testing, then you want to be warned that the file is out of date
	after doing a test run of the script.

E	should implement tagpath, and/or multiple tags files as well.

E	it would be nice if ^X!! reran the last command into [Output]

E	g should become a region command.  Then it could take ranges, as
	it should, and could also become an operator command.

E	adjust window size of popups based on length of buffer.  currently
	popups get half the window they're splitting, no matter what

E	collapse command execution code to as few places as possible.
	Its currently spread through execute(), operator(),
	docmd(), and usekreg().
	
E	mlreply line should ideally be a one line buffer, so editing
	and history can be done on it.

E	BSD interrupt processing is botched during a read() of the keyboard.
	The read doesn't return -1 as it does under sysV (USG).
	So you can bang on ^C all day and nothing will happen.  It does work
	if you're not in a read(), of course.
	
E	I haven't even come close to testing vile for
	memory-full conditions.  Some malloc() packages give 95%
	warnings -- perhaps something like that should be done for
	safety.

E	marks should perhaps be linked onto lines.  this would make a lot
        of things a lot easier, since a mark would travel with the
        line, instead of having to be moved when the line is
        reallocated etc.  the U line could be treated as a special
        mark.  The "copied" flag needed by undo could be a special
        sort of mark as well.  Implementation of the "tag stack"
	would be aided by this as well.

E	:e and :n should be able to deal with multiple filenames resulting
	from filename globbing.  vi has this problem too.  At least
	vile lets you choose to choose the first such name.  if should show
	you the first name, so you know whether to accept it or not.

E	vi lets you say: "set ai nows ic".  These must be separate commands
	in vile.

E	When a line is too long to fit on the screen, you have to move
	over it to see the rest, and when you get to the edge of the screen,
	it jumps. I would prefer a smooth(er) scroll.

E	File completion would be nice for commands asking for filenames.
	This saves a lot of typing.

L	"I found a problem when using vile with encrypted files.  During a file
	edit if I set the mode to crypt and save the file, I am prompted
	for a encryption key.  When I try to read in this encrypted file in
	another session using "vile -kcryptkey file".  I am prompted for
	the encrypt key and when I type it in, I get the message
	"Encryption String: IOT trap".  "  [ Anyone wanting to work on this,
	I can send you more info -- pgf ]

E	The vi '_' command isn't supported -- it's similar to stuttering
	when used as an operator controller, and similar to '^' when used
	as a simple motion.


E	Do autoindent after labels and case statements (lines ending in ':')
	Alternately, _back_up_ if you type either of `case ' or `default:'.
	and shift back all the way to the left for `label:'
	In either case) then return the `normal' indent for the next line.

E	in autoindent mode: 0^D and ^^D don't work

E	can't search for a NUL in a buffer.

===================================================

I just noticed this.  Given the following (view with :set list), if you
move to the blank line right before aaa, and do d} you will notice that the
cursor is left out at column 10.  In my opinion this should not happen.  It
is certainly not vi-like.  First vi would not accept a line with ten blanks
on it as a paragraph break.  I can live with this incompatibility.  Second
vi would leave the cursor at column 1.  This is annoying.  Each time I do
d}, the cursor jumps to the end of the resulting "blank" line.

It starts to get really amusing (pathetic) at the start of the last
paragraph in the buffer (no blank lines at the end of the buffer) as each
d} merely chops one byte at a time from the current line until the current
line becomes blank, then the last real paragraph gets deleted.  Hmm, on
this short test case I cannot reproduce this last behavior.  Actually I
get slightly differing behavior depending on what's in that last
paragraph.  Also, y} moves the cursor when I'm at the beginning of one of
these funny "blank" lines.  That's not nice either.

    Is it possible to get vile to prompt you if you try to exit without
    viewing all the files that were given on the command line?

    It would be nice if the cmode-style autoindenting would do the
    same thing with () and [] as it does with {}.  This would be
    useful for writing function calls with lots of arguments.
[ hard ]

    In cmode, is it possible to get vile to return to the previous
    indentation on the line after a # directive?


===================================================

    There is a bug in the regular expression code.  The expression
's/./=/g' should change all the characters on the lines to an equal
sign.  Yet, here is what happens:

	This line should turn into all equals:

	but, :s/./=/g yields:
        =h=s=l=n= =h=u=d=t=r= =n=o=a=l=e=u=l=:

    Every other character is skipped.  (A pointer incrementing problem?)
I wish I had time to pry into the regular expression code, but with two 
kernels crying out to be fixed, I can't see that happening anytime soon.  
Sorry!

    The ed 'transfer' and 'move' commands don't work. 
    (to copy and move text around.  e.g., :'a,'bt$.)

===================================================

    vile running in an xterm terminal has the
annoying habit of moving the status bar line when scrolling up with
^U or ^E.  This leads to the impression of 'flicker' that is very
hard to get used to.  Is there any easy fix for this, or is this a
consequence of the way the termcap entry is set up?

(add "use scroll regions" setting to force there use, termcap notwithstanding)

	- globbing (e.g. ":e *.c") does nothing under DOS -- the code in
	expand_wild_args() can probably be used to accomplish this.

	- filter-region -- this would be easier if I had used named pipes
	as the conduit between child and parent, instead of regular pipes,
	'cause then I could just replace the named pipe with a tmp file
	under DOS.	

	- some function keys return 8 bit characters on the PC.  This means
	the input path, through tgetc, has to be 8-bit clean, we need to
	allow 256 bindings instead of the current 128, and we can't use
	0x80 as the definition of the SPEC bit.  All this is easy -- it
	just needs to be done.

	- there used to be a "set screen {25|43|50} command -- what happened
	to it?  should 'set-variable $sres "CGA"' do the same thing?  if not,
	what's it for?

Firstly - UNISYS 80286, EGA screen, 4DOS command shell & NNANSI.SYS

1) Attempting to shell out to 4dos results in running COMMAND.COM.  Is
   this because COMSPEC is not checked ?

2) Attempting to redirect the output of a 4DOS internal command into a 
   buffer works erratically.

	a) :e !dir		- never works
	b) ^X-!dir		- works BUT when followed by;
	   ^X-!set		- I get the dir listing again.


3) During testing I noticed another odd result when running the command;

	:!set

   I notice that the output starts on the status line and will overwrite
   it before continuing onto other lines.  However running

	:!dir

   appears to print out just fine.

4) Points 1) & 3) I have previuosly raised with Peter Ruczynski on his
   version.

Sigh, well, I removed vile from my DOS box today.  Reason:  earlier
today I had cut over to it as my editor of choice and I noticed that
after using vile for a long period of time and then typing:

    :w        (save file)

I would get an error message from vile saying that it was unable to
access [PRN] (the DOS printer port).  Vile then gave me an opportunity
to Retry or Abort?, but ignored all responses from the keyboard,
including ^C.  I had no choice but to reboot.  Oh well, I figured, just
a fluke.  But then the same problem occurred an hour later.  At that
point I saw no alternative but to remove the program from disk.  I sure
can't debug this problem because I know for a fact that the PC version
of Vile is not using your released base of source code (it can't be
because it handles command line file globbing, which your source does
not support for DOS).


===================================


PCVILE


1) PC-vile wants all of its filenames to be specified with back 
   slashes.  Blech.  Everybody's DOS products (except Microsoft) accept
   both backward and forward slashes in filenames.

2) PC-vile quickly exhausts DOS memory when it opens a large file
   or a large tags file.  This can easily be fixed with a compiler
   that supplies a DOS extender (ala Intel's CodeBuilder).  The
   problems I was experiencing with attempts to "write to PRN" may
   also be related to out-of-memory conditions that aren't being
   trapped by DOS or the editor.

3) If your screen starts out in 50-line mode when you enter PC-vile,
   and then exit, PC-vile puts the screen in 25-line mode.  Not
   nice.

4) If you start editing PC-vile with a full block cursor, PC-vile
   switches you back to a small underscore cursor.  Veeeeerrrrrrry
   unfriendly.

5) PC-vile scrolls the screen a page at a time when you browse code
   with the 'j' or 'k' key.  This is totally contrary to the way
   Vi scrolls code and it annoys me tremendously.

6) PC-vile does not internally glob file names (e.g., :r t*.c) does
   not work.

7) The supplied makefile does not work under DOS due to command
   line overflow (but you knew that).
