	(E means enhancement, L,M,H are low, medium, high priority)
----------------------
H	do a 'd/.PP' at the start of a line containing ".PP"

H	sys/filio.h and FIONREAD aren't there under ULTRIX  (POSIX?)

H	try building on the NeXt and the Sony.

H	the gotoeop motion and regions interract wrongly.  For instance,
	using ^W} to write the rest of the paragraph to a file writes
	the wrong number of characters.

M	make ^W work in kbd_string

M	the section chars should be in variables and should perhaps be regexps

M	the file accepted for c-mode should be expressable as regexps

M	add "set autowrite", ":n file" (what does that do?)

M	output doesn't flush properly after a shell escape

M	longnames cause severe portability constraint -- does the shortnames
	stuff take care of this?  I can't test it...

L	should I make the "value'd" modes be variables?  should I add 
	some syntax checks to "set" to call set-variable if it has an '='?

L	searching is slow

E	:k, to set a mark, won't work as ":ka" or ":kb".  Must use ":k a"

E	patterns as addresses do not work, e.g. ":/str1/,/str2/d".  They're
	hard to parse the way things are set up right now.  We could accumulate
	the whole commandline, and then parse it, the way real vi does, but we'd
	lose the "prompt and display last response" behavior.

E	In vi, the join command is supposed to act either on a region (from
	the command line, as in ":13,15j"), or it should take a simple
	count, from vi mode, as in "3j".  Right now vile _only_ does the
	simple count form of the command.

E	should add an option to support file locking, rather than the
	current ifdef stuff -- but this is only useful if we match the
	GNU locking protocol, which I'm not inclined to do

E	Wow. the scrsearch functions could become region based -- as in "search for
	the next occrence of the region", which would usually be a word.  And
	the ^A/ version could become "a/ (search for teh contents of buffer a),
	if you know what I mean.

E	need a "file newer than buffer" warning.  Should stat the file, and
	store it's mod time, compare to current when going back to that window,
	after performing some shell command.  e.g., if you're editing a file
	that is created by a script you're testing, then you want to be warned
	that the file is out of date after doing a test run of the script.

E	should be able to refer to remote tags file, and have paths
	contained there be relative to _its_ location, rather than the current
	directory.  possibly a tagspath, and/or multiple tags files as well.

E	add a command-line expansion character to be the list of files
	mentioned in "tags"

E	another mode, which will "!get -p" an SCCS or RCS file if 
	the clear-text file isn't found

E	it would be nice if ^X!! reran the last command into [Output]

E	add support for sh or C comments to formatregion() code

E	g should become a region command.  Then it could take ranges, as
	it should, and could also become an operator command.

E	add C comments to CFENCE matching code

E	add C ifdefs to CFENCE matching code

E	adjust window size of popups based on length of buffer.  currently
	popups get half the window they're splitting, no matter what

E	collapse command execution code to as few places as possible.
	Its currently spread through execute(), operator(),
	docmd(), and usekreg().
	
E	mlreply line should ideally be a one line buffer, so editing
	and history can be done on it.

E	BSD interrupt processing is botched during a read() of the keyboard.
	The read doesn't return -1 as it does under sysV (USG).
	So you can bang on ^C all day and nothing will happen.
	[I'm not sure this is true anymore  -pgf]
	
E	I haven't even come close to testing vile for
	memory-full conditions.  Some malloc() packages give 95%
	warnings -- perhaps something like that should be done for
	safety.

E	marks should perhaps be linked onto lines.  this would make a lot
        of things a lot easier, since a mark would travel with the
        line, instead of having to be moved when the line is
        reallocated etc.  the U line could be treated as a special
        mark.  The "copied" flag needed by undo could be a special
        sort of mark as well.  Implementation of the "tag stack"
	would be aided by this as well.

E	there is currently no way to change working directories -- it's
	not clear whether that should be a global thing, or perhaps
	a per-buffer notion.

E	there is code (in imdying()) that attempts to save unwritten buffers
	on hangups.  It is fairly crude, having been written quickly
	in self-defense during debugging.  It should be examined and
	fixed.

E	:e and :n should be able to deal with multiple filenames resulting
	from filename globbing.  vi has this problem too.  At least
	vile lets you choose to choose the first such name.  if should show
	you the first name, so you know whether to accept it or not.

E	All code should pass lint.  This won't be easy... :-)
