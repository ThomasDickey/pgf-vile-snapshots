VILE -- VI Like Emacs: a vi workalike put together from Micro-Emacs by Paul Fox
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This editor grew out of a frustration that although lots of eager
	programmers have tackled rewrites of Emacs, with new and better 
	features (not to mention free source), I've not seen anything
	similar done with the Second True Editor.  (The First, of course,
	being /bin/ed)

	So I took a copy of MicroEmacs 3.9 (which I've since discovered was
        out of date, unfortunately) and bashed and badgered it into a vi
        work-alike.  It retains the multiple buffer/multiple window
        features of uemacs, but the "finger-feel", if you will, is very
        much that of vi.  The collective developers of Micro-Emacs should be
        complimented that the changes were as easy as they were.  The code
        was pretty clean and well designed before I started on it.  I'm not
	sure that the same can be said anymore...

	Although I can't imagine the emacs folks wanting to buy much of this
	stuff back (insert mode, anyone? (grin), they might want to look at:
		- full global undo
		- tags support
		- better (maybe?) UNIX terminal handling
		- better UNIX shell escapes
		- terminal scroll support
		- multiple yank registers (formerly called kill buffers)
		- multiple marks  (actually kind of messy)
		- improved aesthetics of window splitting and deleting
		- "next error" cursor positioning
		- list mode

	The benefits over standard vi include:
		- multiple files open at once
		- multiple windows on the screen
		- a larger set of operator commands
		- the possibility of porting to your favorite micro.
			(mind you, I haven't even tried this on a small
				UNIX machine, let alone DOS etc...)
		- more uniform undo/yank register treatment
		- tags doesn't lose your last search pattern
		- "next error" cursor positioning
	  Of course, it _may_ lack some of vi's reliability. (grin)

	Take a look at vile.hlp for more information about features and
	differences.

	I have not tried this on a small system, or even _any_ non-UNIX
	system.  I'm sure some work will be required to make it work on
	DOS again, for instance -- especially for spawning sub-shells, etc.

	I ifdef'ed out the language features (user-defined procs, etc.) a
	long time ago -- I don't know if they still work, though I didn't
	actively try to break them.

	Hope you enjoy --
