README for vile
----------------

4/93:

Well, here's the second net posting of vile.  The first was a long time
ago.  Tom Dickey has been contributing a _whole_ lot of good changes.  Vile
now runs on VMS, and is much more stable on DOS thanks to him.

One thing that's changed since I first started vile is that "lots of eager
programmers" have now tackled rewrites of vi.  There are several good work-
alikes out there: elvis (the "king" :-), xvi, vim, stevie, vip-mode in GNU
emacs.  From what little I've used any of these, they all seem like real
good programs.  Vile feels different from most of them, mainly due to its
roots in MicroEmacs.  You may or may not like it.  If you don't, try one of
the others.  There's certainly no reason to not have a vi-like editor on
just about any machine you choose.  Enjoy.

Oh yes -- building it.  On UNIX, type "make", and choose one of the predefined
targets.  Like "make linux".

Under DOS we have Turbo-C support -- there are two makefiles: mktbls.mak
and vile.mak.  First build mktbls.exe, then run "mktbls cmdtbl" and "mktbls
modetbl".  That'll build the headers you'll need to build vile.exe using
the second makefile.  The current compiler of choice is Turbo C, but
Microsoft C used to work, and so probably would again without too much
work.  (The makefile support for msc is next to useless, though -- if
anyone puts together a good nmake makefile, could you pass it along?

The latest version of vile is usually available for ftp at "ftp.cayman.com",
in the pub/vile directory.  Sometimes there's a compiled DOS binary there
too.  I don't maintain a mailing list, or anything like that to inform folks
of new releases -- you just sort of have to check once in a while, or send
me mail...

9/92:

I don't have much to add to the original README -- vile has gotten a lot
better since I first released it, thanks to a lot of users and a lot of
bug reports.  It compiles and runs without modification on most major UNIXes,
and under DOS.  It offers vi finger feel, and most (not all) of its features.
I hope it fills someone's need out there.  -pgf 9/92

(Special thanks to Dave Lemke and Pete Rucszinski, for X and DOS support,
and (in no particular order) to Eric Krohn, Willem Kasdorp, J.C.Webber,
Warren Vik, Julia Harper, Chris Sherman, Thomas Woo, Yanek Martinson, Miura
Masahiro, Tom Dickey for lots of bug reports and suggestions and patience.)

VILE -- VI Like Emacs: a vi workalike put together from Micro-Emacs by Paul Fox
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This editor grew out of a frustration that although lots of
	eager programmers have tackled rewrites of Emacs, with new and
	better features (not to mention free source), I've not seen
	anything similar done with the Second True Editor.  (The
	First, of course, being /bin/ed)

	So I took a copy of MicroEmacs 3.9 (which I've since
	discovered was out of date, unfortunately) and turned it
	into a vi "feel-alike".  It retains the multiple
	buffer/multiple window features of uemacs, but the
	"finger-feel", if you will, is very much that of vi.  It is
	definitely not a clone, in that some substantial stuff is
	missing, and the screen doesn't look quite the same.  But what
	matters most is that one's "muscle memory" does the right thing
	to the text in front of you, and that is what vile tries to do
	for vi users.   THIS IS NOT A "CLONE"!  But it feels good.
	(Put another way, the things that you tend to type over and
	over probably work -- things done less frequently, like configuring
	a .exrc file, are quite different.)

	This is the second really public release of vile.  Users of
	previous versions will hopefully find many new features -- see the
	CHANGES file for details.

	The collective developers of Micro-Emacs should be
	complimented that the changes were as easy as they were.  The
	code was pretty clean and well designed before I started on
	it.  I'm not sure that the same can be said anymore... 

	The benefits over standard vi include:
		- multiple files open at once
		- multiple windows on the screen
		- a larger set of operator commands
		- the possibility of porting to your favorite micro.
		- more uniform undo/yank register treatment
		- using tags doesn't lose your last search pattern
		- "next error" cursor positioning after compilation
	Of course, it _may_ lack some of vi's reliability. :-)

	Take a look at vile.hlp for more information about features
	and differences. 

	In general, I suspect that the quality of the code is roughly
	on a par with MicroEmacs.  I've been using vile regularly under
	both SunOS and 386 UNIX for almost two years, with no major problems
	(that haven't been fixed).  Version three was built and used by
	many others on the net, and their feedback was invaluable.
	I think all of the reported bugs have been fixed, and hopefully
	not too many new ones introduced.

	I have not run this much on a small system, and not much at all on
	DOS.  Pete Rusczinski has done an excellent job of porting
	version three to DOS -- his changes are now incorporated here (as
	of version 3.20), but since in general the DOS version has been
	less well exercised than the UNIX version, it probably harbors
	more bugs.

	Hope you enjoy --

	work-alike.
