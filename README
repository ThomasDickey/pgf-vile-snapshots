VILE -- VI Like Emacs: a vi workalike put together from Micro-Emacs by Paul Fox
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This editor grew out of a frustration that although lots of
	eager programmers have tackled rewrites of Emacs, with new and
	better features (not to mention free source), I've not seen
	anything similar done with the Second True Editor.  (The
	First, of course, being /bin/ed)

	So I took a copy of MicroEmacs 3.9 (which I've since
	discovered was out of date, unfortunately) and bashed and
	badgered it into a vi "feel-alike".  It retains the multiple
	buffer/multiple window features of uemacs, but the
	"finger-feel", if you will, is very much that of vi.  It is
	definitely not a clone, in that some substantial stuff is
	missing, and the screen doesn't look quite the same.  But what
	matters most is that one's "muscle memory" does the right thing
	to the text in front of you, and that is what vile tries to do
	for vi users.   THIS IS NOT A "CLONE"!  But it feels good.

	This is the second really public version of vile.  Users of
	previous versions will hopefully find many new features -- see the
	CHANGES file for details.

	The collective developers of Micro-Emacs should be
	complimented that the changes were as easy as they were.  The
	code was pretty clean and well designed before I started on
	it.  I'm not sure that the same can be said anymore... 

	The benefits over standard vi include:
		- multiple files open at once
		- multiple windows on the screen
		- a larger set of operator commands
		- the possibility of porting to your favorite micro.
			(mind you, I haven't even tried this on a small
				UNIX machine, let alone DOS etc...)
		- more uniform undo/yank register treatment
		- using tags doesn't lose your last search pattern
		- "next error" cursor positioning after compilation
	Of course, it _may_ lack some of vi's reliability. :-)

	Take a look at vile.hlp for more information about features
	and differences. 

	In general, I suspect that the quality of the code is roughly
	on a par with MicroEmacs.  I've been using vile regularly under
	both SunOS and 386 UNIX for about a year, with no major problems
	(that havn't been fixed).  Version three was built and used by
	many others on the net, and their feedback was invaluable.
	I think all of the reported bugs have been fixed, and hopefully
	not too many new ones introduced.

	I have not tried this on a small system, or even _any_
	non-UNIX system.  I'm sure work will be required to make
	it work on DOS again, for instance -- especially for spawning
	sub-shells, etc. 

	Hope you enjoy --
